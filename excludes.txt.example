# Available Variables:
# $DIR       : Refers to the script's directory. Useful for excluding log files or temporary files located in the script's folder.
# $BASE_PATH : Refers to the base directory for your services as defined in the YAML configuration. This can be used to exclude paths within each service's directory.
# Common system environment variables like $HOME are also available for use, making it easy to exclude files in user-specific directories.

# Example Exclusions for SQLite, SQLite3, and other .db-related files
# These files are often excluded since database backups are handled separately.
*.sqlite
*.sqlite3
*.db
*.db3
*.db-shm
*.db-wal

# Exclude backup log as it's actively being written to
# This prevents the backup log from being included in the backup, which could cause issues.
$DIR/logs/backup.log

# Example: Exclude Plex Cache Directory
# Plex Media Server instructions recommend excluding the Cache directory to save space and avoid backing up frequently-changing cache data.
# You can comment out or replace this with other cache directories.
# $BASE_PATH/plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Cache

# Example: Exclude Plex database directory (if you're dumping databases separately)
# If you're handling backups of the Plex database in a different way (e.g., via a dump), you can exclude this directory.
# $BASE_PATH/plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases

# Example: Exclude files in your home directory using the system environment variable $HOME
# This is useful for excluding common user-specific paths, such as downloads or cache directories.
# $HOME/Downloads
# $HOME/.cache

# Add additional exclusions below, depending on your application or service-specific needs.
# For example:
# Exclude a service's temporary files
# $BASE_PATH/my_service/tmp
# Exclude logs from another service
# $BASE_PATH/my_service/logs
